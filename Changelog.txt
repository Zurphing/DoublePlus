KNOWN ISSUES:
When fighting a Data Org member that has newly added music, the original song that used to play for them might play for a brief second in the cutscene.
Soul Eater's text showing its stats when equipping/deequipping it from the menu will go off the page.
The Dream Shield lies face-down when you're choosing a weapon against Seifer in Twilight Town.
There are some VERY specific scenarios with keyblade swapping that could lead to a crash. 
In general, try not to change out your keyblades while you're already in a drive form.
In the majority of cases, it should be fine, but for some bizarre reason, having Ultima Weapon equipped to Base Sora & Final Form
and swapping your keyblade will lead to a crash.
Frost Crystal & Lightning Shard's item picture will reuse a different tier of Synthesis item.
