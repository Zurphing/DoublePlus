# DoublePlus
Port of Double Plus to OpenKH Mod Format </br>
This version of Double Plus is compatible with the GoA Randomizer, but can also be played on its own. </br>
If using with the GoA Randomizer, please install this mod **underneath GoA-ROM-Edition & the Seed you're currently playing.** </br>

When using alongside GoA ROM & a randomizer seed, some features of Double Plus will be overwritten, like updated MP Cost for Magic & Drive Gauge cost for Valor & Anti. </br>

Features Absent: </br>
Shortcut Forms have been removed. Please either download `TopazTK/KH-ReFined` or install `Zurphing/LUA_MultipleShortcutMenus` as a lua script to access them. </br>
For better compatibility between different visual mods, Sora's texture changes & Keyblade model swaps have been removed from this version. </br>
Please use `Zurphing/DoublePlusFull` instead if you'd want to restore them. </br>


Currently still needs: itempic, remastered textures, text-swap of Distance Dash & Distance Step (Currently, equipping Distance Step gives you Distance Dash & vice versa)
Tentative: Split Double Plus into Double Plus & Double Plus Modelswaps, so people can choose to install model swaps.
